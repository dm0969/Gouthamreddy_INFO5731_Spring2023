The locations are nice, costume design, sound design, etc. But it is overall a soft release not worth seeing in theaters.. specially as a follow-up to what Endgame was.The biggest problem for me, is how the underwritten lead has muddled personality (for reasons covered in the story) devoid of charm, personality or good dialogue.The next issue is the humor, which didn\\'t land for me.. Not once. The supporting lead Awkwafina isn\\'t her normal \"loud\" self that\\'s supposed to be funny every time she opens her mouth. Her role is very supportive and a little dramatic. And while I questioned myself why was she even there for, it doesn\\'t ultimately matter. She is another forgettable character that is given more importance than the role deserves.Finally, the third act is weak. There\\'s a balancing problem with stakes. You can\\'t feel tension or weight to any action. And there\\'s a lot of superficial \"I can\\'t do it\" until they can.In the end, this feels like a very safe plot, written in a way to appeal to china (considering how the Mandarin is portrayed), that ends up appealing to no one specific. Certainly doesn\\'t feel like a Marvel movie.. but it was bound to happen if we are to be introduced to different aspects of the narrative. But it also doesn\\'t feel like a comic book. It\\'s more generic than that.',\n",
              " 'The characters are a bit incoherent and straight up contradict their own characterizations at times, because the plot needs them to do it. There are a bunch of unneeded \"deux-ex machina\" or conveniences because the writers trapped themselves into corners for no reason (that\\'s what happens when you get the 2021 \"Mortal Kombat\", \"WW84\" and \"The Expendables\" writers).Also, we have Awkwafina destroying every type of scene (dramatic; epic; and also the comedic ones) with one of the worst \"acting\" I\\'ve ever seen and a same type of joke (\"awkward nonsense\") over and over, from start to finish, with a role ridiculously large for a dumb comic relief.But... Liu is actually pretty good as a lead (and his character is potentially great), and the \"Shang-Chi world\" is beautiful and it has everything to be super fun to watch in the future...without Awkwafine and better writers.',\n",
              " \"Everything comes in it beautiful science fiction and beautiful mythical creatures. Sometimes you have creatures that don't seem real, but these just seemed real. Well done! There was a bit of avatar feeling in it. Fighting for the safekeeping of peace. Really beautiful. And self-acceptance was also nicely incorporated.\",\n",
              " \"Destin Daniel Cretton's 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' marks a bland start to the new phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is a spectacle with regards to action sequence and fighting choreography, but the film misses a solid storyline for an origin story as its titular character lacks personality and does not go through any heroic transformation story arc. Simu Liu has a strong presence as Shang-Chi, yet he is overshadowed by many of his more experienced co-stars.\",\n",
              " \"The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team? What's her super power... stupidity? Don't get me wrong, I love her, but her character was lazily written. Then there's the whole daddy issues dynamic - Shang is with him, then against, then with etc.. Then we have these ridiculous dragons fighting, where one scores some power crystals and becomes stronger! This is just infantile lazy writing. There was zero shock value or anything spectacular in the entire runtime, with tedious long middle acts and a bumbling third act. The jokes were cliched and not funny. The funniest parts were Ben Kingsley's character, (of whom was in this for what reasons??) and the ending to go Karaoke - which was the only time I actually cracked a chuckle. You'd think with three writers we'd have something cohesive and coherent. But instead of a Marvel superhero story, we got a Disney evil vs good with dragons thrown into the mix. It's as if they tried too hard to create the Asian version of Black Panther.It's a shame, because the directing and cinematography were spot on, and great S/VFX - although a little overboard with the CGI i.e. Dragons. The martial arts choreography was outstanding (although again, overboard after the awesome bus scene), and the casting and performances were excellent, especially Leung, who pretty much carried the film on his shoulders. It's a 7/10 from me.\",\n",
              " 'I\\'ll be honest - Marvel movies are not in my top 20 or even 50 but within the Marvel \"Universe\" I would say that Shang-Chi is in my top 5. I know, it\\'s blasphemy and all that but think about it - is it better than Iron Man? I would admit yes - it\\'s origin story is arguably better, and it\\'s characters are a lot deeper. The Mandarin is a conflicted man, with evil but good as well, like real life. Is this movie better than The Avengers or Ragnarok or Infinity Wars? Hard to say, which means it\\'s right up there with the best (of Marvel) in my opinion.Plus, I\\'m a sucker for Chinese movies with the Chinese language being spoken - 1 of my favourite of all times, if not my absolute favourite, is of course \\'Hero.\\' The Chinese language and the artistry of it\\'s culture are magnificent.All in all, well done Marvel, director Destin, and all those who worked to make this movie a reality. This is not just your average summer action movie; it\\'s close to being a Masterpiece. And the humour is pretty swell too!Cheers.',\n",
              " \"I am not a big fan of the many, many Marvel films. The only reason I saw this one was that my oldest daughter insisted I watch it....and overall I was impressed by the movie, though I think it was enjoyable more for the insane eye candy than the story itself.I could talk about the plot but just noticed that there are over 2000 reviews for this film. So, I'll just say that it looked great and would have been great to have seen it on the big screen. The story itself, though enjoyable, wasn't one that particularly grabbed me or impacted on me...possibly because it was so violent and frenetic that the film, as a consequence, lacked intimacy and humanity.\",\n",
              " \"Shang-Chi is one of Marvel Comic's most unknown and underutilized characters in their comics, with his original comics containing a decent amount of racist imagery and embarrassing caricatures of various Asian stereotypes. At it's best, the MCU can turn any obscure group or concept from the comics into gold, and Shang-Chi is no different.Shang-Chi might be one of the best examples of an idea that's actually better on film than the original source material, with the character's relationships, motivations, and place in the overall Marvel Universe all being improved upon in the film adaptation as opposed to the comics where he's mainly a hand-to-hand expert with no powers or special weapons, and isn't generally of much value to The Avengers.Simu Liu is charismatic and athletically gifted enough to do solid justice to the lead role. I hope the sequel gives him even more to do with his character and his legacy, but for an introduction, this was great. Awkwafina, Michelle Yeoh, and of course the legendary Tony Leung all lend their talents to a great cast of characters.Wen Wu is easily one of the top villain/antagonist characters in the MCU and probably all of comic book films. He's intimidating and masterful as a ruler, but heartfelt and believable as a family man. His presence elevates the entire production as he's a legend of cinema.There's moments reminiscent of Black Panther, and the third act gets heavy into Chinese mythological imagery, but understand that this is not only meant as a superhero movie, but also a love-letter to Chinese storytelling and culture.Shang-Chi features some of the best physical/non-super powered fight scenes in the MCU, with the choreography and the cinematography of said action taking a higher level. As soon as I saw the bus fight scene in the opening I had no worries about this part of the movie.The Ten Rings themselves are not a weapon used in the comics, and are a wonderfully creative, versatile, and visually stunning weapon unlike anything I've ever seen before, and that's not an easy thing to say having seen as much comic book and sci-fi material as me.Some of the pacing and character development could be a little better, but overall Shang-Chi is on the higher end of Marvel movies, and can also be solidly enjoyed by audiences totally unfamiliar with Marvel in general.\",\n",
              " 'RATED 8/10\\nLanguage: English\\nSource: Hotstar\\nRECOMMENDEDThe story and making is worth to watch in big screen with good sound system.

              " \"The best marvel movie after Endgame. The story is a bit cliché but the rest is absolutely amazing. The fight scenes are the best in the MCU in my opinion. Simu Liu as Shang-Chi is perfectly chosen and all the other characters are nice and the all the actors do a good job. Act 3 is on another level that we haven't seen before in MCU and the visual effects are spectacular, by far one of the best origin stories from Marvel!\",\n",
              " \"Watched the IMAX version! Best solo since Iron Man (2008)! I had no expectations of this before. But the movie is much more lively. Enjoyed every moment. And also very engaging from start to finish. A kinda Cute-Action movie with some fun stuff!This is the first movie that focuses more on martial arts than Marvel's superpower thing. Love to see a mix of Marvel's MASTER-LEVEL-CGI with Martial art. Kung-Fu with this kind of visual effect! Marvel nailed it again.I've always loved Marvel's casting. Katy is too perfect for her role. Loved her chemistry with Shaun. Also laughed out loud at her childish stuffs.Just one thing, not a big deal, the action scene of 'Dragon Riding' doesn't fit into the usual Marvel movie. But as Chinese flavor, it is OK. Except for this, the cinematography and VFX are a lot mesmerizing!\",\n",
              " 'Shang-Chi is a boring film. The characters were okay, but the story was choppy and confusing. The song choices were odd. Plus, this movie was way too long. And the scene at the end had me practically falling asleep.',\n",
              " \"Let's agree that it is a bad movie from multiple points of view. It depends a lot on the visual effects, its main characters can be funny but not nice, the story does not generate much interest and we have seen the fights many times and in a better way in almost any film produced in Hong Kong, Indonesia or Thailand of the last twenty years. The only thing that saves this film is the karaoke scene that is unexpectedly welcome. The rest is routine, mediocre, tiring and bland.\",\n",
              " \"Shaun (Simu Liu) and Katy (Awkwafina) are slackers in San Francisco. Well, they're Chinese slackers which means that they still have jobs. They're just dead-end jobs. Unbeknownst to Katy, Shaun's real name is Shang-Chi and he was trained from childhood to fight by his father Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) who has been conquering for a thousand years with the Ten Rings until he met the love of his life, Shang-Chi's mother.This is MCU doing an Asian hero and it's actually pretty funny. Awkwafina does her comedic thing. Simu Liu does a good every-man performance but he's also a good straight man to Awkwafina. I like the pairing although they may be better as friends. Then the movie surprises with a comedic turn from Ben Kingsley. I love that part which gave the movie a comedic jolt. I wouldn't mind him popping up in other MCU stuff. The dragon fight is a little blah but those climatic battles are getting standardized anyways. This is a fine addition to the MCU and these are fun characters to add to the gang.\",\n",
              " \"Martial arts meets the MCU in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. More Crouching Tiger than Jackie Chan, the plot for the film is kinda hum-drum, the sort of mystical Eastern fantasy cobblers that practically writes itself.Shang-Chi is the son of immortal, power-hungry warlord Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) and Li (Fala Chen), a warrior woman from the hidden village of Ta Lo. After falling in love with Li and becoming a father, Wenwu gives up his wicked ways and packs away the ten legendary rings that gave him much of his power. However, after his wife is killed by his old enemies, Wenwu once again wears the rings and trains his son to become an assassin. Ashamed of what he has become, Shang-Chi goes into hiding in America and becomes Shaun (Simu Liu), but his past eventually catches up with him when his father sends his army, The Ten Rings, to steal the pendants given to him and his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) by their mother. Wenwu requires both pendants to reveal the way to Ta Lo, where he believes that his wife is being held captive by her people.This Marvel movie is at its most fun before the plot starts to get in the way and the CGI becomes too overbearing and intrusive: the early fight scenes - a battle on a runaway bus against a henchman known as Razor Fist, and a fight on some high-rise bamboo scaffolding - deliver lots of impressively choreographed action that will please both martial arts fans and superhero addicts. Awkwafina, as Shang-Chi's loyal friend Katy, provides some comic relief, but also gets stuck in with the action.Unfortunately, the film quickly goes downhill after the good guys make their way to Ta Lo, with a little help from Tony Slattery (see Iron Man 3) and a furry winged creature with no face. The inevitable battle between the villagers and Wenwu's army is typical overblown Marvel mayhem, but the massive CGI tsunami arrives when Wenwu opens the inter-dimensional gate that he thinks is holding Li prisoner: instead of releasing his wife, he frees a swarm of flying tentacled soul-suckers and their big bad boss The Dweller. Fortunately for the Ta Lo people, they have a massive magical dragon on their side, which wakes up and adds to the digital whizz-bangery.As technically impressive as the special effects are, I found the second half of the film visually overwhelming yet remarkably uninvolving - a whirlwind of pixels and noisy action without much substance.5/10. It was nice to see HK/Chinese stars Michelle Yeoh, Tony Leung and Yuen Wah together in a Marvel movie; I just wish it had been a better one.\",\n",
              " \"As far as visuals go, this movie is amazing... like just about as impressive as Dune, it's filled to the brim with eye-candy.The plot/story however is mediocre and filled with plot holes... the characters' actions are often unrealistic and they will often just 'stare in awe' at their friends being killed, instead of doing the realistic thing, and immediately defending their friends... it's something that happens like 5 times and honestly spoils the movie for me.... if characters in a movie don't act or react realistically and stare at something like a braindead zombie (like their friends getting killed right in front of them, whilst they are holding a gun in their freeking hands), then it's just really terrible script/plot writing.Overall, the movie isn't as bad as Ant-Man 2 but it's not far behind. Also, Awkwafina's acting style was already old by the 2nd movie she did... ALL of her characters in movies are the same person, and like I said, it got boring after the 2nd movie. I roll my eyes at everything Awkwafina's character does in the movie.It's a 5/10 movie, not really worth a watch unless you're a real die-hard Marvel fan.\",\n",
              " \"It was an okay movie. Simu Liu is the son of the seemingly immortal master of the Ten Rings --always good to see Tony Leung, and I hope he soaked Disney --who winds up opposing his dad, and Awkwafina is his slacker sort-of girlfriend. They are fine in the leads, as is Meng'er Zhang as his sister, and Michelle Yeoh as their aunt -- always good to see her, and I hope she soaked Disney too.I have grown increasingly fond of martial arts films over the last couple of decades, and the decline of the movie musical is the reason why. They don't make movies like that any more, and when they try, they're often embarrassing. People don't like the unreality of people bursting out into song, or expressing their emotions through dance. No, they prefer the solid commonplace of people floating through space to kick each other in the head. To me, the fight choreography is its own dance, and the fight between Leung and Fala Chen when they meet and before they fall in love is a challenge dance as graceful as any between Astaire and Rogers.There are problems aplenty with this film. There's an immense amount of exposition, starting off with twenty minutes of it in Chinese. I'm not sure why Ben Kingsley as the fake 'Mandarin' from IRON MAN 3 is present except for a certain remnant of star power and connecting this to the rest of the MCU. Still, with my expectations not set particularly high, I had a good time.\",\n",
              " 'I\\'ve said this before about Marvel movies: they are a victim of their own success. \"Shang-Chi\" had to follow up a decade and a half of quality MCU movies, so the same movie that would\\'ve been a smash 10 years ago isn\\'t viewed quite the same today. The movie was good, but it failed to really separate itself.\"The Legend of Ten Rings\" as a title already sounds too much like LOTR. And in fact it was something like it in that he with the rings had the power. Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) had the ten rings which gave him near omnipotence. With the ten rings he could defeat entire armies and live forever. He decided to use the rings to become a tyrant.He was willing to put his rings aside and grow old for the love of his life, a woman he found after living 1000 years. I thought it was a bit strange that it took the man 1000 years to find his true love, but I didn\\'t dwell on it.Stranger than him taking a thousand years to find his true love was the woman who fell in love with him. She lived in a secret magical village in Macao that was totally isolated from the rest of the world. She was a gentle benign character who had powers herself and was able to defeat Wenwu when he came to essentially conquer her village. Somehow, through their Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon-esque battle they fell in love. Maybe that makes sense for him being that he finally found someone who could defeat him, but it didn\\'t make sense for this nearly pure woman to fall for a man with a 1000 year history of tyranny.Still, they wed, forsook their powers and started a family.Their family would be unceremoniously destroyed when an old foe of Wenwu--a vicious gang--came by their house to get their pound of flesh and killed Wenwu\\'s wife, Li (Fala Chen). Li could\\'ve attempted to barter with them for some sort of material exchange for their past losses, but instead she immediately decided she\\'d try to fight the entire gang and lost her life in the process. That would cause Wenwu to don the ten rings again and return to tyranny.So, if you\\'re keeping score on Wenwu\\'s wife, 1.) she was smitten with a man who came to destroy her village and 2.) she chose to fight an entire gang with no powers to speak of and with no attempts to negotiate.I recognize that it was a plot device to advance the plot, but it could\\'ve been done a lot better and with more tact. Her character never struck me as someone impulsive and/or not able to judge character yet she exhibited both flaws.Most of what I\\'ve covered was garnered throughout the movie via flashbacks. The real main character was Saun aka Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). He was the son of Wenwu and Li. Years later we see an adult Saun. He lives in SF and is a valet. He is violently thrust back into the life he ran away from when his father\\'s goons came for the pendant around his neck given to him by his mother. It was at this point we learned his backstory, of which I\\'ve given some already. We find out he also has a sister, Xialing (Meng\\'er Zhang), who Disney not so subtly informed us she had to train herself to become a fierce warrior because of her gender. The two of them had been split up for close to twenty years when Saun ran away after being trained to be an assassin by his father. He was fourteen at the time and she was ten when he promised her he\\'d be back. He never came back and when they met again in Macao as adults she held the same ten-year-old bitterness against him for running away as though a fourteen-year-old should\\'ve been more reliable. She greeted him with a butt-kicking that was twenty years in the making. It\\'s clear that it never crossed her mind that he may have been killed, or maybe she would\\'ve considered his death a betrayal as well. Either way it was a completely childish way to handle reuniting with your long lost brother.The two of them would join forces along with Saun\\'s friend Katy (Awkwafina) and really quickly to stop their father. He was going to use the ten rings to breach a portal to another dimension which contained some soul-sucking demons.The introduction of demons to the movie did offer some excitement. It upped the stakes of everyone involved and thrust another Marvel character into the role of saving the world.Saun would save the world with the help of his friends and family. Some would die, but the most important characters lived. I was somewhat satisfied with the movie. The acting was commendable and Awkwafina was good as the comic relief. \"Shang-Chi\" may just be the placement of a singular brick to build to something bigger, I just hope what Marvel is building towards is worth it.',\n",
              " \"It had potential but marvel has this tendency of degrading everything into mindless comedy...Things just happen, to an extent where Awkwafina is now an avenger...\\nI'm getting too old for this s#.t..\",\n",
              " \"Really entertaining movie. Actors were great Simu Liu brought it big time he is excellent as the main character. Awkwafina is hilarious and I wish she had more screen time. As far as Marvel movies goes, it's not the best one but still very good.\",\n",
              " \"Simple as that, it's worth watching. Luckily I had Subtitles on for the Chinese speaking parts, and that helped, especially at the start of the movie (about 10 minutes). Don't forget the end credit scene at 2:01:46.\",\n",
              " \"I really liked that the actors spoke their native language, Mandarin, because it would've felt too Americanized otherwise. But there was something unfinished about this movie and I'm not sure what it is. The pacing was alright, a little too slow or fast at times, and as far as storylines go, it was not as exciting as I thought it would be. The fight scenes were great though, especially the final grand battle scene.\",\n",
              " \"To see Sir Ben Kingsley reprise his role as comedy relief for a movie that already has us suffering through another Awkafina performance is sad and redundant. This is what happens when Disney and Marvel try too hard to find a path forward after Endgame. The Asian theme is new but the vague attempts to tie the movie to the MCU smack of desperation. This is just not a good movie. A lot of expensive visuals but that does not make a movie good. Lots of narrative and exposition to explain the visuals but that does not make the movie good or interesting. I understand that it is show business and this movie was made to make money but if I hadn't been lucky enough to watch it on Disney+ I would feel cheated.\",\n",
              " \"This is the worst marvel movie I have seen to date.after seeing the movie I was honestly surprised by all the high ratings. Did we watch the same thing? The movie is without a soul. Characters aren't build up enough even with a 2 hour run time. The movie literally got nothing to do with the ten rings. Movie became Godzilla vs King Kong at the end. Waste of 2 hours. Honestly clueless why people high praised for this movie. What a waste of opportunity to create a wonderful and authentic world for Asian marvel universe.\",\n",
