"The 'minor visual blemishes' for me were that the edges of the case are a bit scuffed. I don't know if it's just paint peeling or if the refurbishing company polished it at all, but it's not rough to the touch or anything; just kinda spotted and not a smooth factory-new finish.Functionally, though, the phone is perfect. They replaced, I THINK, the display specifically? because in the settings menu there's a little warning that the 'screen may not be a certified part'. I mean, okay, not like I'm gonna try to get a warranty replacement on it, right? I've heard/read things about that if the camera(s) are replaced, FaceID and/or ARKit won't function, but at least for mine, THAT didn't seem to be an issue - works just fine.I don't know the standard/expected battery life, but I can say that I charged the phone overnight to 100% (indicated), and then left it turned on at home, connected to Wi-Fi in terms of using signal in any way; after about a 10-hour workday, when I came home, it was down to 85%. Again, not sure how this measures up to a healthy unit, and can't tell you how thirsty it is under load, but for a unit in standby that feels like a normal drain?"

"Siri doesn't work, cosmetically great besides the ear speaker broken out. Has great battery life, I am on my phone constantly and the battery life lasts ALL day long. Face recognition works the way it's supposed to! BUT like I said Siri does NOT work, that causes issues when I am trying to do hands free while I am driving or washing dishes. It's an inconvenience BUT just thought I would say something so maybe it doesn't happen to someone else."

"It started out as a bad situation because I wasn't sure if I was going to get my phone or a refund.  Originally it was suppose to be delivered then, all of a sudden it was late, then it was a possibility it had been returned to seller due to it not being deliver for 5 days. I ended up picking it up from the shipping place. After I received it; it was exactly as advertised and in excellent condition.  So, I'm so glad it turned out good.. I am definitely grateful.."

"We had to purchase our daughter a new phone last minute seeing as hers fell off the counter and broke, she couldn't use it because the touch screen got broke. Anyway, instead of getting the same model we upgraded her to the mint apple iPhone 11, we just received it today so can't comment on how it operates much yet, but I do want to say that she's absolutely in love with it and the color! The seller was very swift at replying to my questions and inquiries on it, they went above and beyond!!! Also, they shipped it right out, and we got it two days sooner then Amazon said we would receive it! 5 stars to the seller!!!"

It has taken me some time getting use to this phone11; I had an SE. The reason I updated was my battery ran down by 4:00 pm every day after a full 10 hr night charge. This phone makes it to 5:00; I expected to hold the charge longer. That is a disappointment because I thought literature said the battery was better than 9 hours.

"I recently received my “ Good Condition ” black iPhone 11 on Saturday. A day earlier than expected! It’s perfect, it only has one very small & faint scratch on the bottom right side & the battery life is 87% otherwise it is in perfect condition. I did have to wait almost 3 hours for the updates, but it was well worth it. I’m very pleased with my purchase & so happy to no longer have my little iPhone 7 lol I love it!!!"

"Shipping was quick and excellent shape described it perfectly. My wife bought an iphone 12 shortly after my purchase that was also supposed to be excellent shape, but it had more noticeable defects than my refurbished 11 so it made me really happy about my purchase. I think there is some variation in what some people call excellent, so you kind of hope to get lucky and have one that someone took extra good care of.  Battery life on my 11 is amazing! Even though it says 86% life, I have had it go 3 full days between charges on occasion when I haven't used it for watching things."

"I got the phone yesterday and came earlier than expected date. So far it works very well, it's fast, and definitely an upgrade from my old Walmart pre-paid. The only thing that somewhat upsets me and I may have to put more money in for this phone is a battery replacement because I got the phone with 74% of battery health. Looks like it'll only last 12-18 hours with how I use my phone. The exterior condition seemed pretty new, especially the screen. The back of the phone has some small yet not-so-noticeable scratches but not upsetting since I just put a case over the back. Just wish I had a better battery life but it's fine for what it is. You're getting a refurbished phone so usually, only noticeable damage or issues will get fixed. The packaging was decent, but seemed like the packaging could've taken a small beating if it were to go through one."

"Phone was in overall good shape.  My only quibble is that the battery health is already down to 81%; for some reason I had it in my brain that with a refurbished phone any worn parts (like the battery) would be replaced and in “like-new” condition.  But perhaps that was my misinterpretation.  Otherwise, phone is great and I’m very happy with the purchase."

"I got the phone yesterday and came earlier than expected date. So far it works very well, it's fast, and definitely an upgrade from my old Walmart pre-paid. The only thing that somewhat upsets me and I may have to put more money in for this phone is a battery replacement because I got the phone with 74% of battery health. Looks like it'll only last 12-18 hours with how I use my phone. The exterior condition seemed pretty new, especially the screen. The back of the phone has some small yet not-so-noticeable scratches but not upsetting since I just put a case over the back. Just wish I had a better battery life but it's fine for what it is. You're getting a refurbished phone so usually, only noticeable damage or issues will get fixed. The packaging was decent, but seemed like the packaging could've taken a small beating if it were to go through one."
"Phone was in overall good shape.  My only quibble is that the battery health is already down to 81%; for some reason I had it in my brain that with a refurbished phone any worn parts (like the battery) would be replaced and in “like-new” condition.  But perhaps that was my misinterpretation.  Otherwise, phone is great and I’m very happy with the purchase."
I just got the phone today but so far it’s pretty good. The battery line is at 96% max capacity. I got a notification about something not being a genuine apple part but it’s working fine so far. The screen probably been replaced and that may be what’s triggering it. There were two scratches on the side but that’s easy to hide with a case. The phone also comes with a screen protector and an off brand iphone charger.
"The 'minor visual blemishes' for me were that the edges of the case are a bit scuffed. I don't know if it's just paint peeling or if the refurbishing company polished it at all, but it's not rough to the touch or anything; just kinda spotted and not a smooth factory-new finish.Functionally, though, the phone is perfect. They replaced, I THINK, the display specifically? because in the settings menu there's a little warning that the 'screen may not be a certified part'. I mean, okay, not like I'm gonna try to get a warranty replacement on it, right? I've heard/read things about that if the camera(s) are replaced, FaceID and/or ARKit won't function, but at least for mine, THAT didn't seem to be an issue - works just fine.I don't know the standard/expected battery life, but I can say that I charged the phone overnight to 100% (indicated), and then left it turned on at home, connected to Wi-Fi in terms of using signal in any way; after about a 10-hour workday, when I came home, it was down to 85%. Again, not sure how this measures up to a healthy unit, and can't tell you how thirsty it is under load, but for a unit in standby that feels like a normal drain?"

"Siri doesn't work, cosmetically great besides the ear speaker broken out. Has great battery life, I am on my phone constantly and the battery life lasts ALL day long. Face recognition works the way it's supposed to! BUT like I said Siri does NOT work, that causes issues when I am trying to do hands free while I am driving or washing dishes. It's an inconvenience BUT just thought I would say something so maybe it doesn't happen to someone else."

"It started out as a bad situation because I wasn't sure if I was going to get my phone or a refund.  Originally it was suppose to be delivered then, all of a sudden it was late, then it was a possibility it had been returned to seller due to it not being deliver for 5 days. I ended up picking it up from the shipping place. After I received it; it was exactly as advertised and in excellent condition.  So, I'm so glad it turned out good.. I am definitely grateful.."

"We had to purchase our daughter a new phone last minute seeing as hers fell off the counter and broke, she couldn't use it because the touch screen got broke. Anyway, instead of getting the same model we upgraded her to the mint apple iPhone 11, we just received it today so can't comment on how it operates much yet, but I do want to say that she's absolutely in love with it and the color! The seller was very swift at replying to my questions and inquiries on it, they went above and beyond!!! Also, they shipped it right out, and we got it two days sooner then Amazon said we would receive it! 5 stars to the seller!!!"

It has taken me some time getting use to this phone11; I had an SE. The reason I updated was my battery ran down by 4:00 pm every day after a full 10 hr night charge. This phone makes it to 5:00; I expected to hold the charge longer. That is a disappointment because I thought literature said the battery was better than 9 hours.

It’s perfect, it only has one very small & faint scratch on the bottom right side & the battery life is 87% otherwise it is in perfect condition.

"We had to purchase our daughter a new phone last minute seeing as hers fell off the counter and broke, she couldn't use it because the touch screen got broke. Anyway, instead of getting the same model we upgraded her to the mint apple iPhone 11, we just received it today so can't comment on how it operates much yet, but I do want to say that she's absolutely in love with it and the color! The seller was very swift at replying to my questions and inquiries on it, they went above and beyond!!! Also, they shipped it right out, and we got it two days sooner then Amazon said we would receive it! 5 stars to the seller!!!"
It has taken me some time getting use to this phone11; I had an SE. The reason I updated was my battery ran down by 4:00 pm every day after a full 10 hr night charge. This phone makes it to 5:00; I expected to hold the charge longer. That is a disappointment because I thought literature said the battery was better than 9 hours.
"I recently received my “ Good Condition ” black iPhone 11 on Saturday. A day earlier than expected! It’s perfect, it only has one very small & faint scratch on the bottom right side & the battery life is 87% otherwise it is in perfect condition. I did have to wait almost 3 hours for the updates, but it was well worth it. I’m very pleased with my purchase & so happy to no longer have my little iPhone 7 lol I love it!!!"
"Shipping was quick and excellent shape described it perfectly. My wife bought an iphone 12 shortly after my purchase that was also supposed to be excellent shape, but it had more noticeable defects than my refurbished 11 so it made me really happy about my purchase. I think there is some variation in what some people call excellent, so you kind of hope to get lucky and have one that someone took extra good care of.  Battery life on my 11 is amazing! Even though it says 86% life, I have had it go 3 full days between charges on occasion when I haven't used it for watching things."
"I got the phone yesterday and came earlier than expected date. So far it works very well, it's fast, and definitely an upgrade from my old Walmart pre-paid. The only thing that somewhat upsets me and I may have to put more money in for this phone is a battery replacement because I got the phone with 74% of battery health. Looks like it'll only last 12-18 hours with how I use my phone. The exterior condition seemed pretty new, especially the screen. The back of the phone has some small yet not-so-noticeable scratches but not upsetting since I just put a case over the back. Just wish I had a better battery life but it's fine for what it is. You're getting a refurbished phone so usually, only noticeable damage or issues will get fixed. The packaging was decent, but seemed like the packaging could've taken a small beating if it were to go through one."
"Phone was in overall good shape.  My only quibble is that the battery health is already down to 81%; for some reason I had it in my brain that with a refurbished phone any worn parts (like the battery) would be replaced and in “like-new” condition.  But perhaps that was my misinterpretation.  Otherwise, phone is great and I’m very happy with the purchase."
I just got the phone today but so far it’s pretty good. The battery line is at 96% max capacity. I got a notification about something not being a genuine apple part but it’s working fine so far. The screen probably been replaced and that may be what’s triggering it. There were two scratches on the side but that’s easy to hide with a case. The phone also comes with a screen protector and an off brand iphone charger.
"The 'minor visual blemishes' for me were that the edges of the case are a bit scuffed. I don't know if it's just paint peeling or if the refurbishing company polished it at all, but it's not rough to the touch or anything; just kinda spotted and not a smooth factory-new finish.Functionally, though, the phone is perfect. They replaced, I THINK, the display specifically? because in the settings menu there's a little warning that the 'screen may not be a certified part'. I mean, okay, not like I'm gonna try to get a warranty replacement on it, right? I've heard/read things about that if the camera(s) are replaced, FaceID and/or ARKit won't function, but at least for mine, THAT didn't seem to be an issue - works just fine.I don't know the standard/expected battery life, but I can say that I charged the phone overnight to 100% (indicated), and then left it turned on at home, connected to Wi-Fi in terms of using signal in any way; after about a 10-hour workday, when I came home, it was down to 85%. Again, not sure how this measures up to a healthy unit, and can't tell you how thirsty it is under load, but for a unit in standby that feels like a normal drain?"

"Siri doesn't work, cosmetically great besides the ear speaker broken out. Has great battery life, I am on my phone constantly and the battery life lasts ALL day long. Face recognition works the way it's supposed to! BUT like I said Siri does NOT work, that causes issues when I am trying to do hands free while I am driving or washing dishes. It's an inconvenience BUT just thought I would say something so maybe it doesn't happen to someone else."

I don't know if it's just paint peeling or if the refurbishing company polished it at all, but it's not rough to the touch or anything; just kinda spotted and not a smooth factory-new finish.Functionally, though, the phone is perfect. They replaced, I THINK, the display specifically? because in the settings menu there's a little warning that the 'screen may not be a certified part'. I mean, okay, not like I'm gonna try to get a warranty replacement on it, right? I've heard/read things about that if the camera(s) are replaced, FaceID and/or ARKit won't function, but at least for mine, THAT didn't seem to be an issue - works just fine.I don't know the standard/expected battery life, but I can say that I charged the phone overnight to 100% (indicated), and then left it turned on at home, connected to Wi-Fi in terms of using signal in any way; after about a 10-hour workday, when I came home, it was down to 85%. Again, not sure how this measures up to a healthy unit, and can't tell you how thirsty it is under load, but for a unit in standby that feels like a normal drain?"
"Siri doesn't work, cosmetically great besides the ear speaker broken out. Has great battery life, I am on my phone constantly and the battery life lasts ALL day long. Face recognition works the way it's supposed to! BUT like I said Siri does NOT work, that causes issues when I am trying to do hands free while I am driving or washing dishes. It's an inconvenience BUT just thought I would say something so maybe it doesn't happen to someone else."
"It started out as a bad situation because I wasn't sure if I was going to get my phone or a refund.  Originally it was suppose to be delivered then, all of a sudden it was late, then it was a possibility it had been returned to seller due to it not being deliver for 5 days. I ended up picking it up from the shipping place. After I received it; it was exactly as advertised and in excellent condition.  So, I'm so glad it turned out good.. I am definitely grateful.."
"We had to purchase our daughter a new phone last minute seeing as hers fell off the counter and broke, she couldn't use it because the touch screen got broke. Anyway, instead of getting the same model we upgraded her to the mint apple iPhone 11, we just received it today so can't comment on how it operates much yet, but I do want to say that she's absolutely in love with it and the color! The seller was very swift at replying to my questions and inquiries on it, they went above and beyond!!! Also, they shipped it right out, and we got it two days sooner then Amazon said we would receive it! 5 stars to the seller!!!"
It has taken me some time getting use to this phone11; I had an SE. The reason I updated was my battery ran down by 4:00 pm every day after a full 10 hr night charge. This phone makes it to 5:00; I expected to hold the charge longer. That is a disappointment because I thought literature said the battery was better than 9 hours.
"I recently received my “ Good Condition ” black iPhone 11 on Saturday. A day earlier than expected! It’s perfect, it only has one very small & faint scratch on the bottom right side & the battery life is 87% otherwise it is in perfect condition. I did have to wait almost 3 hours for the updates, but it was well worth it. I’m very pleased with my purchase & so happy to no longer have my little iPhone 7 lol I love it!!!"
"Shipping was quick and excellent shape described it perfectly. My wife bought an iphone 12 shortly after my purchase that was also supposed to be excellent shape, but it had more noticeable defects than my refurbished 11 so it made me really happy about my purchase. I think there is some variation in what some people call excellent, so you kind of hope to get lucky and have one that someone took extra good care of.  Battery life on my 11 is amazing! Even though it says 86% life, I have had it go 3 full days between charges on occasion when I haven't used it for watching things."
"I got the phone yesterday and came earlier than expected date. So far it works very well, it's fast, and definitely an upgrade from my old Walmart pre-paid. The only thing that somewhat upsets me and I may have to put more money in for this phone is a battery replacement because I got the phone with 74% of battery health. Looks like it'll only last 12-18 hours with how I use my phone. The exterior condition seemed pretty new, especially the screen. The back of the phone has some small yet not-so-noticeable scratches but not upsetting since I just put a case over the back. Just wish I had a better battery life but it's fine for what it is. You're getting a refurbished phone so usually, only noticeable damage or issues will get fixed. The packaging was decent, but seemed like the packaging could've taken a small beating if it were to go through one."
"Phone was in overall good shape.  My only quibble is that the battery health is already down to 81%; for some reason I had it in my brain that with a refurbished phone any worn parts (like the battery) would be replaced and in “like-new” condition.  But perhaps that was my misinterpretation.  Otherwise, phone is great and I’m very happy with the purchase."
I just got the phone today but so far it’s pretty good. The battery line is at 96% max capacity. I got a notification about something not being a genuine apple part but it’s working fine so far. The screen probably been replaced and that may be what’s triggering it. There were two scratches on the side but that’s easy to hide with a case. The phone also comes with a screen protector and an off brand iphone charger.

My wife bought an iphone 12 shortly after my purchase that was also supposed to be excellent shape, but it had more noticeable defects than my refurbished 11 so it made me really happy about my purchase. I think there is some variation in what some people call excellent, so you kind of hope to get lucky and have one that someone took extra good care of.  Battery life on my 11 is amazing! Even though it says 86% life, I have had it go 3 full days between charges on occasion when I haven't used it for watching things."
"I got the phone yesterday and came earlier than expected date. So far it works very well, it's fast, and definitely an upgrade from my old Walmart pre-paid. The only thing that somewhat upsets me and I may have to put more money in for this phone is a battery replacement because I got the phone with 74% of battery health. Looks like it'll only last 12-18 hours with how I use my phone. The exterior condition seemed pretty new, especially the screen. The back of the phone has some small yet not-so-noticeable scratches but not upsetting since I just put a case over the back. Just wish I had a better battery life but it's fine for what it is. You're getting a refurbished phone so usually, only noticeable damage or issues will get fixed. The packaging was decent, but seemed like the packaging could've taken a small beating if it were to go through one."
"Phone was in overall good shape.  My only quibble is that the battery health is already down to 81%; for some reason I had it in my brain that with a refurbished phone any worn parts (like the battery) would be replaced and in “like-new” condition.  But perhaps that was my misinterpretation.  Otherwise, phone is great and I’m very happy with the purchase."
"The 'minor visual blemishes' for me were that the edges of the case are a bit scuffed. I don't know if it's just paint peeling or if the refurbishing company polished it at all, but it's not rough to the touch or anything; just kinda spotted and not a smooth factory-new finish.Functionally, though, the phone is perfect. They replaced, I THINK, the display specifically? because in the settings menu there's a little warning that the 'screen may not be a certified part'. I mean, okay, not like I'm gonna try to get a warranty replacement on it, right? I've heard/read things about that if the camera(s) are replaced, FaceID and/or ARKit won't function, but at least for mine, THAT didn't seem to be an issue - works just fine.I don't know the standard/expected battery life, but I can say that I charged the phone overnight to 100% (indicated), and then left it turned on at home, connected to Wi-Fi in terms of using signal in any way; after about a 10-hour workday, when I came home, it was down to 85%. Again, not sure how this measures up to a healthy unit, and can't tell you how thirsty it is under load, but for a unit in standby that feels like a normal drain?"
"Siri doesn't work, cosmetically great besides the ear speaker broken out. Has great battery life, I am on my phone constantly and the battery life lasts ALL day long. Face recognition works the way it's supposed to! BUT like I said Siri does NOT work, that causes issues when I am trying to do hands free while I am driving or washing dishes. It's an inconvenience BUT just thought I would say something so maybe it doesn't happen to someone else."
"It started out as a bad situation because I wasn't sure if I was going to get my phone or a refund.  Originally it was suppose to be delivered then, all of a sudden it was late, then it was a possibility it had been returned to seller due to it not being deliver for 5 days. I ended up picking it up from the shipping place. After I received it; it was exactly as advertised and in excellent condition.  So, I'm so glad it turned out good.. I am definitely grateful.."
"We had to purchase our daughter a new phone last minute seeing as hers fell off the counter and broke, she couldn't use it because the touch screen got broke. Anyway, instead of getting the same model we upgraded her to the mint apple iPhone 11, we just received it today so can't comment on how it operates much yet, but I do want to say that she's absolutely in love with it and the color! The seller was very swift at replying to my questions and inquiries on it, they went above and beyond!!! Also, they shipped it right out, and we got it two days sooner then Amazon said we would receive it! 5 stars to the seller!!!"
It has taken me some time getting use to this phone11; I had an SE. The reason I updated was my battery ran down by 4:00 pm every day after a full 10 hr night charge. This phone makes it to 5:00; I expected to hold the charge longer. That is a disappointment because I thought literature said the battery was better than 9 hours.
"I recently received my “ Good Condition ” black iPhone 11 on Saturday. A day earlier than expected! It’s perfect, it only has one very small & faint scratch on the bottom right side & the battery life is 87% otherwise it is in perfect condition. I did have to wait almost 3 hours for the updates, but it was well worth it. I’m very pleased with my purchase & so happy to no longer have my little iPhone 7 lol I love it!!!"

I just got the phone today but so far it’s pretty good. The battery line is at 96% max capacity. I got a notification about something not being a genuine apple part but it’s working fine so far. The screen probably been replaced and that may be what’s triggering it. There were two scratches on the side but that’s easy to hide with a case. The phone also comes with a screen protector and an off brand iphone charger.

Originally it was suppose to be delivered then, all of a sudden it was late, then it was a possibility it had been returned to seller due to it not being deliver for 5 days. I ended up picking it up from the shipping place. After I received it; it was exactly as advertised and in excellent condition.  So, I'm so glad it turned out good.. I am definitely grateful.."
"We had to purchase our daughter a new phone last minute seeing as hers fell off the counter and broke, she couldn't use it because the touch screen got broke. Anyway, instead of getting the same model we upgraded her to the mint apple iPhone 11, we just received it today so can't comment on how it operates much yet, but I do want to say that she's absolutely in love with it and the color! The seller was very swift at replying to my questions and inquiries on it, they went above and beyond!!! Also, they shipped it right out, and we got it two days sooner then Amazon said we would receive it! 5 stars to the seller!!!"
It has taken me some time getting use to this phone11; I had an SE. The reason I updated was my battery ran down by 4:00 pm every day after a full 10 hr night charge. This phone makes it to 5:00; I expected to hold the charge longer. That is a disappointment because I thought literature said the battery was better than 9 hours.
"I recently received my “ Good Condition ” black iPhone 11 on Saturday. A day earlier than expected! It’s perfect, it only has one very small & faint scratch on the bottom right side & the battery life is 87% otherwise it is in perfect condition. I did have to wait almost 3 hours for the updates, but it was well worth it. I’m very pleased with my purchase & so happy to no longer have my little iPhone 7 lol I love it!!!"
"Shipping was quick and excellent shape described it perfectly. My wife bought an iphone 12 shortly after my purchase that was also supposed to be excellent shape, but it had more noticeable defects than my refurbished 11 so it made me really happy about my purchase. I think there is some variation in what some people call excellent, so you kind of hope to get lucky and have one that someone took extra good care of.  Battery life on my 11 is amazing! Even though it says 86% life, I have had it go 3 full days between charges on occasion when I haven't used it for watching things."
"I got the phone yesterday and came earlier than expected date. So far it works very well, it's fast, and definitely an upgrade from my old Walmart pre-paid. The only thing that somewhat upsets me and I may have to put more money in for this phone is a battery replacement because I got the phone with 74% of battery health. Looks like it'll only last 12-18 hours with how I use my phone. The exterior condition seemed pretty new, especially the screen. The back of the phone has some small yet not-so-noticeable scratches but not upsetting since I just put a case over the back. Just wish I had a better battery life but it's fine for what it is. You're getting a refurbished phone so usually, only noticeable damage or issues will get fixed. The packaging was decent, but seemed like the packaging could've taken a small beating if it were to go through one."
"Phone was in overall good shape.  My only quibble is that the battery health is already down to 81%; for some reason I had it in my brain that with a refurbished phone any worn parts (like the battery) would be replaced and in “like-new” condition.  But perhaps that was my misinterpretation.  Otherwise, phone is great and I’m very happy with the purchase."
"The 'minor visual blemishes' for me were that the edges of the case are a bit scuffed. I don't know if it's just paint peeling or if the refurbishing company polished it at all, but it's not rough to the touch or anything; just kinda spotted and not a smooth factory-new finish.Functionally, though, the phone is perfect. They replaced, I THINK, the display specifically? because in the settings menu there's a little warning that the 'screen may not be a certified part'. I mean, okay, not like I'm gonna try to get a warranty replacement on it, right? I've heard/read things about that if the camera(s) are replaced, FaceID and/or ARKit won't function, but at least for mine, THAT didn't seem to be an issue - works just fine.I don't know the standard/expected battery life, but I can say that I charged the phone overnight to 100% (indicated), and then left it turned on at home, connected to Wi-Fi in terms of using signal in any way; after about a 10-hour workday, when I came home, it was down to 85%. Again, not sure how this measures up to a healthy unit, and can't tell you how thirsty it is under load, but for a unit in standby that feels like a normal drain?"
"Siri doesn't work, cosmetically great besides the ear speaker broken out. Has great battery life, I am on my phone constantly and the battery life lasts ALL day long. Face recognition works the way it's supposed to! BUT like I said Siri does NOT work, that causes issues when I am trying to do hands free while I am driving or washing dishes. It's an inconvenience BUT just thought I would say something so maybe it doesn't happen to someone else."

I just got the phone today but so far it’s pretty good. The battery line is at 96% max capacity. I got a notification about something not being a genuine apple part but it’s working fine so far. The screen probably been replaced and that may be what’s triggering it. There were two scratches on the side but that’s easy to hide with a case. The phone also comes with a screen protector and an off brand iphone charger.
